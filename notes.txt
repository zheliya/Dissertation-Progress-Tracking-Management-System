1- Abstract:

The goal of this project is to create an effective system for coordinating projects and communicating with supervisors and postgraduate students. The existing methods of supervising multiple students and tracking updates, such as using Moodle and relying on emails, have proven inadequate. This challenge can be overcome by developing a web-based application that allows students and supervisors to work seamlessly together. Each project consists of chapters and subtasks that can be customized by supervisors. You can submit files, communicate, evaluate, and access past submissions in dedicated sections. Any updates or submissions will be notified by email.
By implementing the system, you will improve communication, improve project management, and streamline the tracking process.

2- Introduction:

In order to complete a project successfully, project management and communication are essential. Moodle and email, however, do not have the flexibility to manage the complexity involved, especially when there are multiple postgraduate students to supervise. This project aims to develop a web application that addresses these limitations and provides a more efficient method for managing project progress and communication. In addition to enhancing collaboration, streamlining communication, and improving progress tracking, the project will create a centralized platform for students and supervisors.

3- Problem Statement:

There are several challenges associated with the current project management methods, such as using Moodle and sending emails. Generally, postgraduate students find it more difficult to reach their supervisors with questions, concerns, and challenges compared to undergradue students for example, becuase most postgraduage students are more lilkly to be employed hence leading to them to have less time and making it more challenging to meet with their supervisors face to face. Supervisors, on the other hand, struggle to effectively manage multiple students and projects due to the lack of a centralized system. Moreover, vital information can be easily lost in the vast amount of emails exchanged. These challenges hinder effective communication, delay progress, and introduce inefficiencies in project management. There is a need for a comprehensive system that enables seamless communication, progress tracking, and efficient project management for postgraduate students and their supervisors.
