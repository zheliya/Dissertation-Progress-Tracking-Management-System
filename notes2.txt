1- Abstract:

The goal of this project is to create an effective system for coordinating projects and communicating with supervisors and postgraduate students. The existing methods of supervising multiple students and tracking updates, such as using Moodle and relying on emails, have proven inadequate. This challenge can be overcome by developing a web-based application that allows students and supervisors to work seamlessly together. Each project consists of chapters and subtasks that can be customized by supervisors. You can submit files, communicate, evaluate, and access past submissions in dedicated sections. Any updates or submissions will be notified by email.
The implemented solution improves communication, enhances project management, and streamlines the progress tracking process.

2- Introduction:

Effective project management and communication are crucial for successful thesis completion. However, existing systems like Moodle and email have limitations in managing the complexities involved, especially when supervising multiple postgraduate students. The aim of this project is to develop a web application that addresses these limitations and provides a more efficient solution for managing project progress and communication. By creating a centralized platform for students and supervisors, the project aims to enhance collaboration, streamline communication, and improve progress tracking.

3- Problem Statement:

The current project management methods, such as using Moodle and relying on email communication, pose several challenges. Postgraduate students face difficulties contacting their supervisors for updates, questions, and challenges. Supervisors, on the other hand, struggle to effectively manage multiple students and projects due to the lack of a centralized system. Moreover, vital information can be easily lost in the vast amount of emails exchanged. These challenges hinder effective communication, delay progress, and introduce inefficiencies in project management. There is a need for a comprehensive system that enables seamless communication, progress tracking, and efficient project management for postgraduate students and their supervisors.
